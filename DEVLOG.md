# Devlog

## Week 1

### 4/13/21 - Group
* Had a meeting together over discord
* Discussed logistical issues
* Cloned the repository onto each person's EWS
* Set up initial .h and .cpp files for our
* Started work on the Airport Class

### 4/18/21 - Group
* Anushya worked on implementing the makefile
* Philip finished the airport class
* John worked on the airports.dat parser

## Week 2

### 4/19/21- Anushya 
* Anushya finished implementing the makefile

### 4/19/21- Group 
* Discussed our workload for the week
1. Philip)  String seperation and airport class
2. John)    Praser Implementation
3. Matt)    Edge-Casees and error handling
4. Anushya) Catch implementation and praser work

### 4/21/21 - Philip
* Got the basic version of parseAirports() working
* Good progress on parseRoutes(), Need a sorted structure of airports o

### 4/21/21 - Matt
* Worked on finding edge cases in the implementation of the parser

### 4/22/21 - Group
* Discussed progress so far
* Worked on plan for friday
* Philip & Matt -   Finish work on parser
* Anushya & John -  Start implementation of BST

## Week 3

### 4/29/21 - Philip
* Added geographical location to airport class
* Worked on the user interface for main.cpp

### 4/29/21 - Group
* Made more progress on Parser class. Specifically, figured out how to search for an airport's location in memory based on airport ID.
* Discussed logistics on where to place geographic distance calculator for weighted graph generation.
* Scrapped BST: it doesn't need to be necessary, since we can just traverse our graph instead. Also, we already have 3 algos.
* TODO next: Philip- Finish the parser. Pagerank, GUI elements. Matheu- Haversine formula. Anushya- Dijkstra's. Contact TA re: BFS valid? Why is makefile not making an executable? John- Dijkstra's.

### 05/02/21 - Group
* Philip - finished Parser implemented GUI structure added geographical location 
* John   - started implementation of Dijkstra's
* Anushya - started implementation of BFS 

### 05/04/21 - Philip and Matt
* Matt planned and described implementation of distance function between two airports utilizing haversine
* Then Philip and Matt called and finished it.

### 05/04/21 - Matt and Philip
* Implemented a distance showchase screen in the program
* Started discussing PageRank implementations

### 05/04/21 - Group
* John)     Discussed Dijkstra's implementation
* Matt)     Brought up possible issues with PageRank
* Anushya)  Discussed about BFS
* Philip)   Added skeleton for Disjkstras visual represenation

### 05/05/21 - Philip
* Implemented average flight time using haversine
* Discovered haversine has issues
* Added loading screen :)
* More UI tweaks
## Week 4

### 05/05/21 - Anushya 

* added BFS & Dijkstras to the make file
* finished BFS implementation 
* TODO: Make test cases, Contact TA.. why isn't makefile working properly?

### 05/07/21 - Group
* John)     Started work on Dijkstra's
* Matt)     Discussed Page Rank
* Philip)   Discussed Page Rank
* Anushya)  Implemented BFS

### 05/08/21 - Anushya 
* made the make file work! 

### 05/08/21 - Philip
* Started and almost finished Page Rank

### 05/08/21 - John
* Finished writing and began debugging Dijkstra's.

### 05/09/21 - Group
* Debugged Pagerank and Dijkstras (somewhat unsuccessfully)

## Week 5

### 05/10/21 - John
* Got Dijkstra's working

### 05/10/2021 - Anushya 
*Added edge case to BFS 

### 05/10/2021 - Group 
* Worked on test cases 

### 05/11/2021 - Anushya 
* worked on test cases 
* cleaned up makefile (got it working correctly)

### 05/11/21 - John
* Added connected component check in Dijkstra's and in main
* Finished testcases for Dijkstra's
* Modified testcases.cpp to only parse once, read many times
* wrote test case(s) for parser.

### 05/12/21 - Group
* fixed testcases 
* fixed memory leaks 
* made presentation video
