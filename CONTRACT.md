# CS 225 Spring 2021 Final Project
## Communication:
1. **Platform**: We will be using discord as our main means of communication. We have a group chat which allows for us to voice chat, text chat, share our screens, and do other useful things. Our meetings will be held on Sundays at 7:00pm CST. If it so happens that one or more members has a time conflict or technology issue, we have snapchat and Facebook to communicate with each other.
2. **Assistance**: Teammates are encouraged to reach out to others with questions or for help regarding technical matters. As stated above, we have a group chat on Discord which will be our main way to interact and receive help. Discord is especially nice because we can leave messages or questions and if a person isn't at their computer right away, they will still be able to see that question in the future and answer it.
3. **Respect**: We all know each other, so the respect is already mostly there. However, it is worth reiterating that respect is of the utmost importance. Disrespect between teammates will not be tolerated, and we'll seek measures to resolve conflicts. One idea was to sit down together and have a stern and serious conversation and make sure everyone's opinion is heard and vocalized.

## Collaboration
1. **Work Distribution**: During our weekly meetings, we will discuss as a group and set goals for each person. For example, if we have 4 tasks to complete, we will evenly distribute the tasks amongst all 4 of our members. This will allow us to evenly spread out the workload to cater to each person's strengths and weaknesses. There will be open communication during the meetings, which means that everyone knows what their responsibility is, and what we can do as a team to successes.
2. **Expected Time Commitment**: The time commitment will vary based on the amount of workload that each person has each week, but our baseline will be at least 2 hours per week, and increasingly more as the workload becomes more intense. If issues come up, we will make exceptions, but we will not tolerate people slacking off.
3. **Conflict Resolution**: If we have issues within the team, we will try to talk things out first, because communication is the most important part of a team. If that doesnâ€™t work, we will decide what to do based on the severity of the situation.
4. **Accountability**: We will also be holding each other accountable to make sure that all of the work we need to do will get done. This will be done at our weekly meetings by first, delegating the work to individual team members for the following week and second, discussing the work we have done over the course of the previous week.
5. **Communication** : We will hold an open line of communication we each other. This will help us better understand where everyone is in the process of completing this project. This way, we can better adjust our long-term plan. For example, if anyone gets behind for any extenuating circumstances, we can adjust our plans accordingly to help us better keep organized. It will also help us ensure that we don't have any issues working as a group and ensure that we get the project done.
